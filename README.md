# ICMSearchButton
A Tampermonkey userscript to add a search button to a movie so you can easily google for this movie. It will open a new tab with a Google Video search, with parameters set to find movies that are long enough.

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY TO BE USED FOR FINDING MOVIES OUT OF COPYRIGHT. I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHER USECASES.
